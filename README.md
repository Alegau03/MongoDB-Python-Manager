# MondoDB-Python-Manager
A manager for Mondo DB, created in Python


You can connect to a local MongoDB or by modifying the code connect to an external database, you can do various operations such as:
- Adding data
- Modifying data
- Deleting data
- Searching for data

Obviously the data format must be common, for my code it is set as (NAME- SURNAME - age- RESIDENCE- DATE OF BIRTH) of course if you want to change the data format by changing the code slightly.
There is no graphical user interface (GUI) integrated, it is all managed on the terminal, the gui is the next update I will make, it is already in development.

Data can be added several at a time using a text file.

Feel free to contact me for clarifications or suggestions
